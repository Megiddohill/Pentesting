This is a repository of the commands you will see in this guide and what their meaning is. 

#basic-command
- ls: Lists the commands in the directory you are in. (ls -al shows hidden files)
- mkdir: makes a directory
- tee or  -o: creates a file
- cd: change a directory
- cat: view the contents of a file
- sudo: synonymous with "root" it allows a command to be executed as a "super user"
- netstat w/-natp: Give a list of port status on your machine
- python -V or python3 -V: checks what version of python or pytho3 you machine is running.
- ./: executes an executable file. Even those in binary
- sort: will sort characters. sort -u by words, sort -V by numbers
- xargs: used to build and execute commands from standard input. It reads items from the standard input or from specified files, separates them with blanks (by default), and executes the command (default is `/bin/echo`) with those items as arguments.

#command-execution
- In penetration testing, you’ll run multiple commands at once, and/or want commands to operate logically, this is where operators come in: **“ ;, ||, &&”** to name a few. Here is what they do in simple terms:
- **;** is used for a sequence of commands.
- **||** is used for a fallback command if the first one fails.
- **&&** is used for a follow-up command if the first one succeeds.

#finding-suids
```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -l
```
1. **`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`:**
    - `find`: The command for searching files and directories.
    - `/`: The starting directory for the search is the root directory.
    - `-perm -u=s`: This option looks for files with the setuid bit set for the user owner. The setuid bit is a permission that allows a program to be executed with the permissions of its owner.
    - `-type f`: Specifies that only regular files are considered (not directories or other types of files).
    - `2>/dev/null`: Redirects error messages (stderr) to `/dev/null`, suppressing any permission denied errors that might occur during the search.
2. **`| xargs ls -l`:**
    - `|`: The pipe symbol connects the output of the `find` command to the input of the next command.
    - `xargs`: Takes the output of the `find` command and passes it as arguments to the `ls -l` command.
    - `ls -l`: Lists detailed information about each file, including permissions, owner, group, size, and modification time.

#crontab
```bash
sudo crontab -e
```
- **`crontab`:** This command is used to create, edit, display, or remove the cron jobs for a user. A cron job is a scheduled task that runs automatically at specified intervals.
- **`-e`:** This option specifies that you want to edit the crontab file.

#pingsweep
```bash
for i in {1..254}; do ping -c 1 192.xxx.x.$i | grep "bytes from" & done`

```
- **`for i in {1..254}; do`:** This starts a loop that iterates over a range of values from 1 to 254. The loop variable `i` takes on each value in the specified range.
- **`ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i`:** This pings the IP address 192.168.1.$i with a count of 1 ping packet. The variable `i` is used to iterate through the IP addresses in the range.
- **`| grep "bytes from" &`:** This pipes the output of the `ping` command to `grep`, which searches for lines containing "bytes from" (indicating a successful ping response). The `&` at the end of the line puts the `grep` command in the background, allowing the loop to continue without waiting for the current `ping` to finish.
- **`done`:** This marks the end of the loop.

#awk-ping command for pingsweep organization
```bash
cat file_name | awk -F ":" '{print $1}' | awk -F " " '{print $4}' | sort -V >> f_name
```
- **`cat file_name`:** This reads the contents of the file named `file_name` and outputs them to the standard output.
- **`|`:** This is the pipe symbol, which takes the output of the command on its left and uses it as the input for the command on its right.
- **`awk -F ":" '{print $1}'`:** This `awk` command uses a colon (`:`) as the field separator (`-F ":"`). It extracts and prints the first field on each line. This assumes that the lines in the file are colon-separated.
- **`|`:** Another pipe symbol to pass the output of the first `awk` command to the next command.
- **`awk -F " " '{print $4}'`:** This `awk` command uses a space as the field separator (`-F " "`). It extracts and prints the fourth field on each line. This assumes that the lines from the previous `awk` command have fields separated by spaces.
- **`sort -V`:** This `sort` command is used to sort the input in a version-number-friendly way. The `-V` option ensures that the sorting is done in a way that is aware of version numbers, treating them as decimal numbers rather than strings.

#scope 
```bash
for i in 192.* ; do echo $i > ./$i/scope; done 
```
- **`for i in 192.* ; do`:** This starts a loop where `i` takes on values that match the pattern `192.*`. This pattern typically matches files or directories in the current directory that start with "192."
- **`echo $i > ./$i/scope`:** This command echoes the value of `i` to a file named "scope" within a subdirectory named after the value of `i`. The `./$i/scope` construct refers to a relative path where each subdirectory is named after the current value of `i`. The contents of the "scope" file will be the value of `i`.
- **`done`:** Marks the end of the loop.
-(note that 192 is a filler for whatever IP address you might be working with)

#start-ssh
```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh.service
```
- **`systemctl`:** This is a command-line tool that interacts with `systemd`, a system and service manager for Linux. `systemctl` is used to control and query the state of the `systemd` system and service manager.
- **`start`:** This is an action parameter for `systemctl`. It is used to start a service.
- **`ssh.service`:** This is the unit name of the SSH service. `ssh.service` is the service unit responsible for managing the SSH daemon on systems that use `systemd`. Starting the `ssh.service` unit means starting the SSH server, allowing incoming SSH connections.
- Note you can replace "start" with "status" to see the current status of SSH or use netstat -natp

#sss-shell
```bash
ssh -N -f -R 127.0.0.1:9080 username@{network address} -p PORT#
```
- **`ssh`:** This is the command to initiate an SSH connection.
- **`-N`:** This option tells SSH not to execute any commands on the remote host. It is used when you only want to establish the tunnel and not execute any commands on the remote machine.
- **`-f`:** This option requests that the SSH client goes to the background just before the command execution.
- **`-R 127.0.0.1:9080`:** This specifies that a reverse tunnel should be created, mapping the remote port 9080 to the local address 127.0.0.1 and port 9080. This means that connections made to the remote port 9080 will be forwarded to the local machine.
    
- **`kali@{ipaddress}`:** This is the username and the IP address or hostname of the remote machine you are connecting to.
    
- **`-p PORT#`:** This specifies the port number on the remote machine to which the SSH connection should be made. The default SSH port is 22, but this option allows you to specify a different one.

#fast-scan
```bash
for ip in $(cat targets); do     sudo proxychains nmap -F -sT -Pn $ip | tee ./ipfast_scan done`
```
- **`for ip in $(cat targets); do`:** This is the beginning of a Bash `for` loop. It iterates over each IP address in the file named `targets`.

    - `sudo`: Run the command with elevated privileges.
    - `proxychains`: Use the `proxychains` tool to route the network traffic through proxies. This is useful for anonymizing the source of the scan.
    - `nmap`: The network scanning tool.
    - `-F`: Fast mode, which scans only the most common 100 ports.
    - `-sT`: Perform a TCP connect scan.
    - `-Pn`: Treat all hosts as online, skipping host discovery.
    - `$ip`: The current IP address being processed in the loop.
- **`| tee ./ipfast_scan`:** This part of the command pipes the output of the Nmap scan to the `tee` command, which both displays the output on the terminal and saves it to a file named `ipfast_scan`.
- **`done`:** Marks the end of the loop.

#aggressive-scan
```bash
for ip in $(cat targets); do sudo proxychains nmap -A -Pn $ip | tee ./$ip/all_scan
```
- **`for ip in $(cat targets); do`:** This is the beginning of a Bash `for` loop. It iterates over each IP address in the file named `targets`.
- **`sudo proxychains nmap -A -Pn $ip`:** This is the Nmap command being executed for each IP address. Here's what each option means:
    - `sudo`: Run the command with elevated privileges.
    - `proxychains`: Use the `proxychains` tool to route the network traffic through proxies.

    - `$ip`: The current IP address being processed in the loop.
- **`| tee ./$ip/all_scan`:** This part of the command pipes the output of the Nmap scan to the `tee` command. `tee` both displays the output on the terminal and saves it to a file named `all_scan` within a directory named after the current IP address (`$ip`). This directory structure helps organize the scan results for each IP address separately.
- **`done`:** Marks the end of the loop.

#service-scan
```bash
for ip in $(cat targets); do sudo proxychains nmap -sV -Pn $ip | tee ./$ip/service_scan
```
- **`for ip in $(cat targets); do`:** This is the beginning of a Bash `for` loop. It iterates over each IP address in the file named `targets`.
- **`sudo proxychains nmap -p- -Pn $ip`:** This is the Nmap command being executed for each IP address. Here's what each option means:
    - `sudo`: Run the command with elevated privileges.
    - `proxychains`: Use the `proxychains` tool to route the network traffic through proxies.
    - `nmap`: The network scanning tool.
    - `-p-`: Scan all ports. This option specifies scanning from port 1 to 65535, covering all possible ports.
    - `-Pn`: Treat all hosts as online, skipping host discovery.
    - `$ip`: The current IP address being processed in the loop.
- **`| tee ./$ip/port_scan`:** This part of the command pipes the output of the Nmap scan to the `tee` command. `tee` both displays the output on the terminal and saves it to a file named `port_scan` within a directory named after the current IP address (`$ip`). This directory structure helps organize the scan results for each IP address separately.
- **`done`:** Marks the end of the loop.

#port-scan
```bash
for ip in $(cat targets); do sudo proxychains nmap -p- -Pn $ip | tee ./$ip/port_scan

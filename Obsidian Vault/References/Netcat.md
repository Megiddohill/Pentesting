Netcat is a versatile networking tool used for reading from and writing to network connections. It operates at the command line and can be used for various networking tasks, including:

**Port Scanning:** Checking for open ports on a remote system
**File Transfer:** Sending or receiving files between systems.
**Network Testing:** Checking the reachability of a network host.
**Chatting:** Establishing a simple chat connection between two systems.

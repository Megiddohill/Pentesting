**Nmap (Network Mapper):** Nmap is a powerful open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. It's designed to explore networks, find open ports, detect services running on remote machines, and perform various other network-related tasks. Nmap is widely used by network administrators and security professionals to assess the security of a network and identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Nmap Scan Commands:
#basic-nmap-command 
**Scanning Open Ports (Fast):** `sudo nmap -F <target> | tee file_name` - Scans for open ports on the target using a fast scan and saves the output to a file.
(when scanning from a file, use: sudo nmap  iL file_name -F <target> | tee file_name )

**Host Discovery:** `sudo nmap -sn <target>` - Performs host discovery to find live hosts on the network.

**Operating System Detection:** `sudo nmap -O <target>` - Attempts to detect the operating system of the target.

**Service Version Detection:** `sudo nmap -sV <target>` - Detects service versions running on open ports.

**Aggressive Scan:** `sudo nmap -A <target>` - Performs an aggressive scan, including OS detection, service version detection, and script scanning.

**Script Scanning:** `sudo nmap -sC <target>` - Runs default scripts against open ports.

**Full TCP Port Scan:** `sudo nmap -p- <target>` - Scans all 65535 TCP ports on the target.

**UDP Port Scan:** `sudo nmap -sU <target>` - Scans for open UDP ports on the target.

**Timing Template (Aggressive):** `sudo nmap -T4 <target>` - Sets the timing template to aggressive.

**IPv6 Scan:** `sudo nmap -6 <target>` - Performs a scan using IPv6.

**Output to XML:** `sudo nmap -oX file_name.xml <target>` - Outputs scan results in XML format.

**Output to Greppable Format:** `sudo nmap -oG file_name.txt <target>` - Outputs scan results in a greppable format.

**Output to Normal Format:** `sudo nmap -oN file_name.txt <target>` - Outputs scan results in a normal (human-readable) format.

**Output to All Formats:** `sudo nmap -oA file_name <target>` - Outputs scan results in all formats (normal, XML, and greppable).

**Ping Scan:** `sudo nmap -sn <target>` - Performs a ping scan to check if hosts are up.

**Service and Version Info Only:** `sudo nmap -sV --version-intensity 0 <target>` - Retrieves service and version information without performing script scanning.

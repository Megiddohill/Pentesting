```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
- `python3`: This is the Python 3 interpreter.
- `-c`: It allows you to provide a command as a string to be executed by Python.
- `'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`: This is the Python code that gets executed. It imports the `pty` module and uses its `spawn` function to start a new interactive Bash shell.
(note if you are running less than python3 you should only use "python" with no 3 attached.)

```bash
SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null
```
- `SHELL=/bin/bash`: This temporarily sets the `SHELL` environment variable to `/bin/bash` for the duration of the command. This means that the shell spawned by `script` will be Bash.
    
- `script -q /dev/null`: The `script` command is used to record a shell session. The `-q` option is used for quiet mode, which suppresses the output that indicates the start and end of each command in the typescript file. The `/dev/null` argument specifies that the output should be saved to the null device, effectively discarding it.

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```

`stty raw -echo`: This command uses the `stty` utility to modify terminal settings.

- `raw`: Sets the terminal to raw mode, which means that input is passed through to the application without any line-oriented processing (e.g., no buffering of input until a newline is entered).
- `-echo`: Disables echoing of characters, meaning that the characters you type will not be displayed on the screen.
- `fg`: This command is used to bring a background job into the foreground. In Unix-like operating systems, when you run a command in the foreground, it typically occupies the terminal, and you can interact with it directly. If you run a command in the background, it continues to execute, but you can still use the terminal for other commands.

<span style="color:#e60505">reset:</span> Does several functions (listed below) but it is used here to reset Terminal Modes.<span style="color:#e60505"> You'll want to perform this step after doing the one above of stty raw -echo; fg</span>
- **Clearing the Screen:** It clears the terminal screen, providing you with a clean and empty screen.
- **Resetting Terminal Modes:** It resets various terminal modes and attributes to their default values. This includes things like character encoding, line discipline settings, and other terminal-related configurations.
- **Resetting Terminal Title:** It often resets the terminal window title to the default.

```bash
echo $TERM
```
used to display the value of the terminal type being used

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
```
- **`TERM`:** It is an environment variable that specifies the terminal type. Terminal types define the capabilities and behavior of a terminal, allowing applications to interact with it appropriately.
- **`xterm-256color`:** This value indicates a terminal that supports 256 colors. It is commonly used for modern terminal emulators that have enhanced color capabilities. Setting `TERM` to "xterm-256color" allows command-line applications to take advantage of the extended color palette.

```bash
echo $SHELL
```
Will output the path to your default shell, which could be something like `/bin/bash`, `/bin/zsh`, or another shell executable.

```bash
export SHELL=/bin/bash
```
- **`export`:** This command is used to set environment variables. When you use `export`, you make the variable available to subprocesses, ensuring that any commands or programs launched from the current shell session recognize and use the specified value.
- **`SHELL`:** This is an environment variable that stores the path to the user's default shell.
- **`/bin/bash`:** This is the path to the Bash shell executable. By setting `SHELL` to `/bin/bash`, you are specifying that Bash should be the default shell for the current user's session.

This guide is made from the divergence penetration testing phase from the Divergence Academy circa the end of 2023. If you have stumbled upon this whilst in the academy I believe I am not in error to say you have hit pay dirt. 

If you are not. This is still a handy guide that I hope will expand to a clear information database of "how to" and "concept grasping". So buckle up. Be ready to apply this information to whatever penetration environment you find yourself in. And happy learning. 

Considerations before starting: 
1. This guide will use ip addresses that you probably will not be. I will endeavor to write clarification like "Victim Port/IP address/machine, Attacker Port/IP Address/Machine. But if I fail to do so by mistake, make sure you engage your head while following along and keep that situational awareness stays on a pivot.

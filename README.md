# Welcome To My Pentesting Obsidian Guide
If you're a new divergence student, this might be your jackpot when you get to pentesting.
If not I still plan on making these guides as a tool for myself and other junior pentesters.

I hope you'll enjoy and learn from this series, and feel free to drop a star if that happens. 

Goodluck and Godspeed.
